<h1>Why Sports Parents Sometimes Behave So Badly</h1>
<h2>Youth sports organizations are increasingly reporting scenarios in which 
parents yell, threaten or physically assault coaches, referees, players or other 
parents.</h2>

<p>&nbsp;A video captured the angry crowd as it swarmed a football field to 
protest a penalty flag. A man grabbed the referee from behind and body-slammed 
him onto the ground.</p>
<p>The players, who looked on, stunned, were 13 years old. The assailant was a 
parent at his son’s youth football game in Albuquerque.</p>
<p>The New Mexico Young America Football League responded by banning the entire 
team for the rest of the season. Parents there, as in many states, are required 
to adhere to a “Parents Code of Conduct” that includes abiding by statements 
such as “I will be in control of my emotions” and “I will remember that the game 
is for our youth — not adults.” That pact had been broken.</p>
<p>Youth sports organizations are increasingly reporting scenarios in which 
parents yell, threaten or physically assault coaches, referees, players or other 
parents. A 2017 study from the National Association of Sports Officials, which 
represents youth, amateur, college and professional sports, found that 40 
percent of officials named parents as the source of unsportsmanlike behavior.</p>
<p>“At our office, there is not a week that goes by that we don’t get video from 
parents of an 8-year-old playing soccer or football and the parent wants us to 
look at the call,” said Barry Mano, the president and founder of NASO.</p>
<p>Sports psychologists are now trying to better understand why a growing number 
of parents are becoming increasingly emotionally overinvested in their 
children’s athletics. They cite several reasons some parents take their child’s 
swim meet or soccer match very seriously.</p>
<p>Money is a top reason. Parents spend a lot of time and financial resources on 
youth sports, which can prompt some to want a payoff greater than watching their 
children perform well or enjoy themselves. Some expect a significant return on 
their investment, perhaps through a college scholarship or professional sports 
contract.</p>
<p>Parents’ behavior covers a wide continuum, said Travis Dorsch, an assistant 
professor and founding director of the Families in Sport Lab at Utah State 
University. On one end, “Mom and Dad are content to spend the money, and they 
are supportive and they don’t say a lot,” Dr. Dorsch said. At the other end, 
parents expect their child to perform well and express disappointment if their 
child or the team does not meet expectations. “In other families, little Johnny 
goes to Orlando for a tournament and doesn’t play, and on the plane ride home 
they have a discussion,” he said.</p>
<p>A 2016 study in the Journal of Family Relations by Dr. Dorsch and colleagues 
found an inverse relationship between a child’s perception of their family’s 
commitment to youth athletics and their enjoyment of the sport. The study 
examined data from a national sample of 163 parent-child pairs — 78 fathers and 
85 mothers. The families were fairly affluent, with a median income topping 
$120,000 a year, and more than three-fourths of the parents had a college 
degree.</p>
<p>Parents reported spending an average of $1,583.89 a year on their child’s 
sports participation, though that ranged widely, with some reporting they spent 
more than 10 percent of the family’s gross annual household income on their 
children’s athletic activities. Families tended to spend more on their sons than 
daughters.</p>
<p>But spending more on the sport didn’t predict a child’s enjoyment of that 
sport. Rather, children who perceived their parents as investing heavily in 
their sport tended to report a greater sense of parental pressure and a reduced 
sense of enjoyment.</p>
<p>Stacy Warner, an associate professor and graduate coordinator for sport 
management at East Carolina University, says a desire to belong is another 
reason some parents become emotionally overinvested in their child’s sports. 
Traveling to tournaments and other investments of time and money can produce a 
tribal effect and sense of community.</p>
<p>“Humans have an innate need to belong to community,” she said. “Places where 
people meet are dwindling. What we have left is sport.”</p>
<p>For parents who build a social life through their child’s sports, Dr. Warner 
said there is a strong desire to protect their position within the community. It 
is, after all, a community membership that can be withdrawn if a child does not 
make the league or the team is cut early from a tournament. A desire to remain 
with the social group can produce a strong emotional response if a parent 
perceives that a referee makes a bad call or a child plays sluggishly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;A desire for community, as well as a need to see a return on 
investment, is not limited to children’s sports participation. Dr. Dorsch’s 
laboratory is also testing parental emotional involvement in the performing 
arts, such as musical theater, orchestra and dance.</p>
<p>“We have data that we’re digging into that shows a very similar pattern,” Dr. 
Dorsch said.</p>
<p>It’s a pattern that sports organizations and officials wish to stop. Mr. 
Mano, the founder of the National Association of Sports Officials, said many 
leagues now escort referees into games. Others require parents to sign a good 
behavior agreement, in which the penalties for violation can range from a parent 
being banned from the stands or a team being barred from finishing the season. 
Other leagues do not allow any parents into specific games or entire 
tournaments.</p>
<p>Although most organizations try to manage parents’ behavior, Dr. Warner said 
the solution comes from providing a sense of community outside of children’s 
activities.</p>
<p>“If parents had adult sport league practices, maybe they wouldn’t sit around 
and watch their kids practice,” Dr. Warner said.</p>
