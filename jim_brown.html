<p>An epidemic of sports burnout is affecting children in Washington and throughout the
United States. Up to 70 percent of all children who participate in youth sports drop out,
and many of them are burned out, by the time they are 13, studies have found.</b> </font></p>

<p>&quot;It's a huge problem,&quot; says Gary Allen, a Woodbridge resident who is director
of soccer coaching education in Virginia, &quot;especially in an area like this where
there are so many kids playing soccer. Parents put them into highly competitive situations
before they really know how to play the game. If they don't enjoy it, they quit.&quot;</p>

<p>The burnout-dropout phenomenon is not restricted to soccer nor to the Washington area.
High school coaches and officials in baseball, tennis, golf, football, swimming and other
sports are lamenting the shrinking pool of talent caused by kids who just don't want to
play anymore. The reasons vary, but the bottom line is that millions of kids are leaving
activities that are supposed to be fun, rewarding and long-lasting.</p>

<p>Among the reasons cited by experts are:</p>

<p>* Starting too soon. Have you heard of wee-ball? It's T-ball for 3-year-olds. Parents
routinely enroll their children in swimming and gymnastics classes as toddlers. An
official of the American Junior Golf Association recalls the parents of an 18-month-old
boy asking about golf lessons for their baby.</p>

<p>This change may be partly indicative of changes in the lifestyle of affluent families.
Many parents think their children will have fun with sports and thus encourage early
participation. And since so many families have both parents working today, children are
often programmed into after-school, weekend and summer sports activities. In addition,
more than a few parents may believe they have the next Tiger Woods, Venus Williams or Tara
Lipinski in the family.</p>

<p>Ron Quinn, a member of the United States Youth Soccer Coaching Committee, says that the
Olympics might actually hurt youth sports. &quot;The Olympics set us back because we get
all of these stories on television about athletes who began training when they were 4. The
message comes through that children have to start early to be good. But the sooner we
start them, the sooner they quit.&quot;</p>

<p>In addition, Allen observes that there is a second round of fallout among children who
were very well developed and very successful as young athletes. &quot;When other athletes
start catching up physically at about the ages of 13 and 14, this group is not so
successful anymore and they start to lose interest.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What most people think of as burnout,&quot; says Riley Eaton, swim coach at the
Martin Luther King Swim Center in Silver Spring, &quot;is young athletes' making decisions
to move on to other opportunities and horizons. Whatever they were doing before doesn't
hold the same attraction as it once did.&quot;</p>

<p>Eaton gets kids at the ages of 13 and 14 who have been swimming since they were 7 or 8.
&quot;The ones who stay in it,&quot; he explains, &quot;begin to compare themselves to a
more select group of athletes. Then they become increasingly aware of their own abilities
and interests, and they make decisions about how far they can go. As a group, kids are a
lot more perceptive than we give them credit for about understanding their talent level.
Some of them may assess the situation and decide to direct some of that time and energy to
other endeavors.&quot;</p>

<p>John Heil, a Roanoke, Va., sports psychologist, also cautions parents of early
achievers about the burnout risk. &quot;If too much of one's sense of worth gets tied up
in a sport, there is not much to fall back on during down times. Developing athletes may
just be going through a plateau or setback period while they are waiting for their
physical capabilities to boost up again. If they have some other things going on in their
lives, they can cope with the adversity.&quot;</p>

<p>Allen adds that the common system of select, elite and travel teams prematurely weeds
out those who might be late bloomers. &quot;We're putting too much emphasis on physically
gifted athletes instead of developing all of those who want to participate. It's no wonder
that we lose more than half of them by the time they are teenagers.&quot;</p>

<p>* Getting too much. By the time some young athletes reach the age of 12, they have won,
lost, traveled, worn uniforms and been awarded trophies more often than most adults. This
may help kids think they've accomplished all they want in sports at an early age. Why keep
on doing it for another four or five years? &quot;A good experience that goes on too long
can cause burnout,&quot; explains Heil. &quot;Parents try too hard to get too much of an
edge too soon.&quot;</p>

<p>* Playing too often. Kids crash and burn because of the sheer number of practices and
games they are forced to play, regardless of when they start. A travel team for
11-year-olds in suburban Atlanta plays more than 100 baseball games in a season. Under-12
girls' softball teams in California play as many as nine games during a single weekend
tournament after having played two or three games during the week.</p>

<p>* Trying too hard. Often the joy of playing a sport is lost for youngsters because
winning becomes paramount to parents and coaches. &quot;Parents make mistakes by
emphasizing performance instead of enjoyment,&quot; says Heil. &quot;They get caught up in
wins and losses and statistics. I call it a downward spiral of professionalism. These
people, especially young coaches who are trying to make a name for themselves, have the
idea that more is better. The lesson that the top athletes in the world have learned is
that over-training leads to decrements in performance. They know that the right amount is
the best amount.&quot;</p>

<p>* Becoming too specialized. Many parents encourage or even force their children to play
just one sport on the assumption that it will allow them to develop more competitive
skills in that sport. There is little or no evidence to support that theory. Randy Hill, a
research assistant for the United States Olympic Committee, says that the one common
denominator shared by most elite athletes is multi-sport participation during the
developmental years. Cathy Sellers, a USA Track and Field official, encourages athletes
not to specialize in a sport until the ages of 12 to 14. Jim Sheridan, a well-known youth
swimming coach in Indiana, requires his elite swimmers to participate in a second sport.</p>

<p>* The bad coach. The child who has a bad coach or a coach who is consumed with winning
at all costs is destined for burnout. Warns Heil, &quot;The child who is a potential star
in one sport and has a bad experience in another may get turned off altogether. The
quality of the coach is essential.&quot;</p>

<p>Parents should do some investigating about the coach before signing up their children.
Find one who has the best long-term interests of your child in mind rather than the one
who is out to win as many games or meets as possible.</p>

<p>WARNING SIGNS</p>

<p>What are the signs of burnout? &quot;My son just flat-out told me that he didn't want
to play in a winter lacrosse league,&quot; says Jim Berkman, a soccer and lacrosse coach
at Salisbury State University in Maryland. &quot;He felt pressure to play because I was
the coach, so I backed off. Now, he's into lacrosse more than ever before, but it's
because he wants to get better. It doesn't have anything to do with me.&quot;</p>

<p>Other parents may not be so lucky. They have to watch out for behavior such as changes
in personality, a drop in grades, chronic fatigue, illnesses and injuries--and even faked
illnesses and injuries.</p>

<p>Berkman and his wife, Jennifer, have encouraged their two children to play as many
sports as they like. Both ended up playing basketball, lacrosse, soccer and baseball.
Terry and Jeri Kirkpatrick of Ridgefield, Conn., used the same strategy: supporting
athletics but never pushing any one sport. Rachel, Sara, and Jeremy Kirkpatrick are still
involved in sports at the high school level, though all started very early. Like the
Berkman children, they played everything early but eventually specialized, on their own,
in one or two primary sports.</p>

<p>Concludes Heil, &quot;It's almost a cliche to talk about fun, but that's what sports
should be for children. My impression is that parents should give them proper supervision,
then get out of the way. If you let them have fun, they will, and they will have a fresh
attitude toward sports for a long time.&quot;</p>
