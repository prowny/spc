The Fear Factor</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">By Sheila K. Rowny </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Director, Sports 
Psychotherapy Center</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">“I keep making mistakes… 
what if I lose the next game… uh oh, my bad knee is acting up… who is playing on 
the next hole… I hope I don’t choke like I did before…”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">There are many reasons why 
an excellent athlete plays poorly or below his or her usual level of ability.&nbsp; 
One very powerful reason is fear, also known as anxiety or “nerves”.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Most competitive athletes 
experience some kind of fear, or anxiety, or worry.&nbsp; This is normal!&nbsp; It arises 
at different times for different players.&nbsp; Some get an upset stomach the night 
before a big match, or vomit when it’s over, win or lose.&nbsp; Some get nervous 
before a big point, with negative thoughts:&nbsp; “I’m going to lose.”&nbsp; Some just get 
all tensed up and make unforced errors when they can’t control their bodies.&nbsp; Or 
they make poor choices when under pressure.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Some people are 
“natural-born worriers.”&nbsp; Even when not playing their sport they tend to think 
ahead or dwell on past problems, expect the worst, worry about taking a test, a 
risk, or performing at school or work.&nbsp; Thinking of past or future problems 
destroys the self-confidence and focus on the present which is necessary for 
playing like a champion.&nbsp; People who are perfectionists also tend to develop a 
fear of losing.&nbsp; They don’t understand that sports, like life, is full of ups 
and downs.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Suppose you started 
entering tournaments at age 10 and won easily and often.&nbsp; You advanced to higher 
levels, winning effortlessly, believing yourself to be a champ, until you got 
beaten for the first time by someone bigger, older, or just better that day.&nbsp; 
The reaction to that loss by yourself, parents, coach or friends can have a big 
impact on future competition.&nbsp; If you experience a negative response to this 
loss, you are more likely to approach the next match with fear – not because of 
your loss but because of your negative interpretation of the meaning of that 
loss.&nbsp; A negative interpretation could be from inside yourself – “I’m such a 
loser” – or seeing a parent’s frown or scowl – “you should have won” – or 
hearing a coach’s critique.&nbsp; You conclude that you can’t play and everyone is 
disappointed in you.&nbsp; And instead of getting over it, you carry fear and 
negative feelings about yourself to the next match.&nbsp; Most of the time these 
reactions involve distorted conclusions about your performance.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Here are some Action Plans 
that will move you beyond fear:</span></p>
<ol>
  <li>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;<u>Goals</u> - set a 
  very specific and immediate goal, and focus only on achieving this goal, right 
  now.&nbsp; For example: “I will serve and volley this point.”&nbsp; “I will aim for the 
  green.”</span></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><u><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Rituals</span></u><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"> 
  – follow the exact same physical and mental routine before and after every 
  point.&nbsp; For example, bounce the ball 3 times, or take a deep breath, or look 
  at the sky, or say to yourself “just concentrate on <u>this</u> shot.”</span></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><u><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Positive Affirmation
  </span></u><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">– identify your negative thoughts: 
  “that was stupid”, or your tense body; and replace it with a positive 
  affirmation.&nbsp; These are examples of positive thoughts to practice both during 
  and between matches:</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">I 
am confident&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am determined</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">I 
love this game&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I trust myself to play my best</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">I 
am alert and focused&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’ll stick to my plan</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notice how your emotions change and 
how your body feels when you try these positive statements.&nbsp; Pick one or two 
that you will use during matches to help you conquer your fears.&nbsp; Notice that 
these affirmations are <u>not about the score or the outcome</u>.&nbsp; You cannot 
control those things, only your own mind and body.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><b><i>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Remember that when you notice a negative thought 
or behavior, it is important to recognize it, without judging or criticizing 
yourself for having that thought.&nbsp; Just calmly and gently replace it with a more 
useful positive affirmation.</span></i></b></p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="4" type="1">
  <li class="MsoNormal"><u><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Maintain Balance In 
  Your Life</span></u><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">.&nbsp; Engage in other fun 
  activities and spend time with positive people outside of your sport.&nbsp; Your 
  identity and self-worth are based on more than wins and losses.&nbsp; Off the 
  tennis court or the golf course, you can improve your attitude by gaining some 
  distance and new perspective.&nbsp; By doing so, you will conquer the Fear Factor 
  and perform your personal best during competition.</span></li>
