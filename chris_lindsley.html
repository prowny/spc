<p>I DECIDED to run the 1995 Marine Corps Marathon having never run more than 10
miles at one time in my life. A minor obstacle that dedicated training would
overcome, or so I kept telling myself.</p>
<p>Things went well at first, as I gradually increased my weekly long run from
10 to 18 miles. There, though, I hit a wall I couldn't break through. I knew I
needed to log some 20-mile plus training runs, but I'd reach 18 and stop.
Physically, I felt as if I could keep going, but mentally I was finished. Not
surprisingly, the same thing happened in the race, as I ended up walking much of
the last eight miles.</p>
<p>That experience taught me that physical preparation alone wasn't enough. I
had to prepare mentally as well. I knew professional athletes worked with sports
psychologists to improve focus, concentration and confidence and otherwise
sharpen their mental game. After a little research into sports psychology,
though, I realized these tips and strategies could also benefit weekend and
amateur athletes like me.</p>
<p>&quot;Anyone can apply and benefit from the principles we use,&quot; says
sports psychologist Wayne Hurr, a staff psychologist at the Georgetown
University Counseling Service and a consultant to the Georgetown athletic
department, who also works with professional and Olympic athletes. &quot;Seeing
a sports psychologist can be particularly helpful when you notice a performance
slump. We look to see what's happening. Is negative thinking affecting your
performance or are you visualizing a bad outcome rather than the outcome you
want to happen? Then we provide techniques to deal with the problem and,
hopefully, optimize performance.&quot;</p>
<p>Consider the case of runner Steve Holman. In 1992 he was an Olympian and NCAA
champion in the 1,500 meters for Georgetown, but by 1995 performance anxiety was
getting the better of him before races. Searching for answers, he started
working with Hurr and credits sports psychology with helping get his career back
on track.</p>
<p>&quot;The emphasis for so long has been on physical preparation, and when
things don't work out you tend to think of it as a physical problem instead of
looking inward at how you're preparing, what kind of goals you're setting and
what your confidence level is,&quot; says Holman, of Arlington, who won his
first national 1,500-meter title in 1999. &quot;[Hurr] introduced me to the
basic concepts of sports psychology, things like relaxation exercises,
visualization and confidence-building exercises. The idea is to have the optimal
psychological mindset to allow what you work on a million times in practice to
come through in a race. I started seeing benefits within a matter of
weeks.&quot;</p>
<p>In many ways, sports psychology is more common sense than calculus. Visualize
success. Exude confidence. Set clear and realistic goals and focus on achieving
them. The trick is not only knowing a positive mental outlook can improve
performance but developing a plan of action that works for you, which is where
sports psychologists come in. The first step, though, is realizing the important
role mental preparation plays in improving performance.</p>
<p>While specific strategies vary by individual, Hurr and Mike McDermott, a
Washington sports psychologist, offer some time-tested tips that can pay
immediate performance dividends.</p>
<p>• Shake off mistakes. &quot;If you watch a Cal Ripken when he makes an
error, he's over it right away,&quot; McDermott says. &quot;He doesn't dwell on
it and he picks up right where he left off. The amateur, though, continues to
replay it in their mind and gets frustrated and loses concentration and
focus.&quot;</p>
<p>• Reconnect with past successes. If you've done well before, expect that
you will do so again. &quot;Think about your best past performance and
everything associated with that, and just re-create that in your own mind,&quot;
Hurr says.</p>
<p>• Visualize your goals. Golfers, for example, should get a mental picture
of where they want to hit the ball before each shot. &quot;You've got to see it
in your mind's eye to do it consistently,&quot; McDermott says.</p>
<p>• Think (and talk) positive. Think about the mental messages you give
yourself during competition. &quot;If you can train those to be positive
messages, you're more likely to relax and approach performance with more
security, which leads to better efficiency,&quot; McDermott says.</p>
<p>• Learn to relax. Hurr says relaxation techniques such as deep breathing
exercises make it easier to achieve the high levels of focus and concentration
vital for peak performance. Relaxation also reduces muscle tension, allowing
your body to move more freely.</p>
<p>Seeing a sports psychologist is comparable in many ways to hiring a personal
trainer or taking sport-specific lessons: They are all good ways to improve
performance. One key difference, though, is the resistance some people have to
seeing a psychologist of any kind. Holman said he talks freely about how Hurr
has helped him in part to encourage others to overcome their hesitation.</p>
<p>&quot;There is some stigma attached to seeing a sports psychologist,&quot;
Holman says, &quot;and that's really unfortunate because that may prevent some
people from getting the help they need. It might be the final piece of the
puzzle to allow people to maximize their potential.&quot;Pro golfers Davis Love
III and Nick Price and Olympic speed skating champion Dan Jansen are just a few
examples of elite athletes who credit sports psychology with improving their
performances.</p>
<p>Holman's one regret with regard to sports psychology is that he didn't start
it sooner; he feels that his career might have turned out differently if he had.
If you're looking to enhance performance, he advises, ask yourself if it's a
mental rather than physical advantage you need most.</p>
<p>&quot;People like to talk about how much they want something . . . but no one
really has a specific plan unless they have problems and see a sports
psychologist,&quot; Holman says. &quot;Even at the high-school level, if people
are brought up in a system where psychological training is as important as
physical training, I think people will have much better performance.&quot;</p>
