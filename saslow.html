<p>Kay Comer sometimes felt stuck in a stranger's body. She looked in the mirror 
last summer and saw few remnants of the scrawny high school freshman whom 
cross-country coaches had once referred to as &quot;lungs with legs.&quot; Comer's hips 
had expanded. Her shoulders had broadened. Her thighs had developed more muscle.</p>
<p>Only a year earlier, Comer won a district championship at Colonial Forge High 
School in Stafford and earned a reputation as Virginia's up-and-coming distance 
runner. Now, even her shortest jogs ended in a hobbled limp.</p>
<p>&quot;I went through a stage where running was hard and it hurt everywhere,&quot; Comer 
said. &quot;I just didn't want to do it.&quot;</p>
<p>Like most female cross-country runners, Comer has faced much greater hardship 
than the typical high school athlete who grows up, builds muscle and improves 
each season. In girls' cross-country, runners are more likely to regress than 
progress. Forty high school sophomores earned All-Met honors -- either first 
team, second team or honorable mention -- between 2000 and 2003. Only 15 of 
those girls, or 38 percent, earned an equal or better distinction as seniors.</p>
<p>Coaches, doctors and athletes blame that decline on a degenerative cycle that 
threatens many young female athletes, particularly distance runners. 
Physiological changes during puberty temporarily make running less natural, and 
rebelling against those changes results in injuries and eating disorders. The 
ailing athlete then loses confidence and, ultimately, interest in the sport.</p>
<p>&quot;It's kind of heartbreaking for the girls to realize that they can try as 
hard as ever and the performance still isn't there,&quot; said Severna Park 
cross-country coach Ed Purpura, whose girls' team won the 2005 Maryland 3A 
title. &quot;It's always the elephant in the room in our sport. Nobody likes to talk 
about it, but everybody knows that's often how it works.&quot;</p>
<p>College and high school coaches estimate that about 80 percent of female 
runners will level off, at least temporarily, because of physiological changes. 
The average girl gains about 10 or 20 pounds during high school, doctors said, 
and much of the added weight consists of natural fat. Nutritionists suggest 
women must maintain at least 17 percent body fat to menstruate; top male 
athletes, meanwhile, often thrive on less than 10 percent.</p>
<p>For female runners, that extra weight can create uncomfortable pressure on 
knees, ankles and shins during high-impact activities. That discomfort is 
compounded by widened hips, which can change a runner's stride and add to the 
stress on her knees.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, the University of Washington studied 60,000 teenage 
athletes and concluded that girls' cross-country had the highest injury rate of 
any sport, with more than 60 injuries for every 100 runners each season. 
Typically, women become strong runners again early in college, coaches said, 
when tendons and muscles adjust to the added weight and compensate for the 
altered stride.</p>
<p>All female athletes must adjust to these body changes, doctors said. But the 
transition is hardest in cross-country, diving, gymnastics and ice skating -- 
activities where small size often is considered advantageous.</p>
<p>Comer, now a junior at Colonial Forge, remains an elite runner, but even the 
best athletes hardly are immune to the trend -- start fast and finish slower -- 
that defines girls' cross-country. While male runners gain height and muscle 
mass during puberty and quickly lower their times, girls struggle to maintain 
early success.</p>
<p>Marissa McPhail, a freshman on a running scholarship at Fresno State, said 
she still hasn't been able to equal the times she ran as a 14-year-old freshman 
at Arundel High School. Comer's times slowed between her freshman and sophomore 
years. &quot;It's kind of like you just had to start running in winter clothes,&quot; she 
said.</p>
<p>&quot;It rocks to be that freshman who is up there with the seniors, but you know 
you're not going to see those same jumps of success later in your career,&quot; said 
Stefanie Slekis, a 2006 graduate of Forest Park High School in Woodbridge. &quot;If 
you start that fast, sometimes you're just trying to hang on.&quot;</p>
<p>Slekis said running felt almost effortless when she was a high school 
freshman and sophomore. She weighed only about 105 pounds, and 3.1-mile 
cross-country races rarely tired her. Now, as a freshman on the cross-country 
team at Syracuse University, Slekis competes at about 130 pounds.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm a stronger athlete, but that was kind of a big transition in terms of 
running,&quot; said Slekis, who adjusted to her natural weight gain and became an 
All-Met as a junior and senior. &quot;When I was a freshman, I was practically frail. 
But I could definitely run fast.&quot;</p>
<p>Coaches and doctors said that young, lean girls possess running advantages. 
Narrow hips allow a girl's legs to hit the ground at a 90-degree angle, reducing 
the strain on ankles and knees. Lighter athletes tend to use oxygen more 
efficiently, so they rarely run out of breath.</p>
<p>Purpura guided Severna Park to the state championship last year with a 
varsity team that comprised four freshmen, two sophomores and a senior. The 
coach sent his runners into the offseason with candid advice. &quot;Next year's 
freshmen are going to be just as good,&quot; Purpura said. &quot;You're going to have to 
work harder to stay where you are.&quot;</p>
<p>But too often, hard work is futile. In the last five years, Severna Park has 
had two all-state sophomore runners who failed to make the varsity team as 
seniors. Purpura said many of his juniors and seniors give up cross-country 
because they feel frustrated and powerless against regression. This season, 51 
girls came out for Purpura's team. Only three were seniors.</p>
<p>&quot;When it's not working out, they vote with their legs and walk away,&quot; Purpura 
said. &quot;They say, 'I don't want to do this anymore.' They find other things 
they're good at or try something new, and who can blame them?&quot;</p>
<p>Said Alison Smith, a senior at Atholton High in Columbia and the two-time 
defending Maryland 2A champion: &quot;You get heavier and you hit a plateau where you 
stop improving. You lose focus and things pile up. It's like, 'How can I ever 
fix this?' &quot;</p>
<p>The only answer, coaches said, usually strikes runners as counterintuitive: 
do nothing. Fighting maturation is pointless, coaches said, and it can lead to 
consequences much more severe than disappointing race results.</p>
<p>Katherine Beals ran on the cross-country team at the University of 
California-Davis more than 20 years ago, and her coaches instituted a strict 
policy against weight gain. Beals and her teammates sometimes weighed in before 
practices, and coaches stood in front of the team and asked certain runners to 
lose weight. As a result, Beals said, at least four or five runners suffered 
from anorexia and bulimia.</p>
<p>Beals has devoted her career to helping athletes prevent such things from 
happening. She wrote a book on athletes with eating disorders. She became a 
nutrition professor at the University of Utah, where she screens incoming 
athletes for dangerous eating habits. Beals estimates that at least one-third of 
collegiate cross-country runners suffer from some sort of eating disorder. Other 
colleges coaches guessed that number could be closer to 50 percent at Division I 
schools.</p>
<p>&quot;It's so common that some coaches almost accept it as part of the sport,&quot; 
Beals said. &quot;With cross-country, sometimes there's actually a reason to be 
thinner, since you have to transport that weight through space. That creates a 
dangerous temptation.&quot;</p>
<p>An eating disorder typically helps an athlete improve as a runner for about 
six months, doctors and coaches said. Then the consequences are inevitable and 
disastrous. An eating disorder often leads to amenorrhea, the absence of 
menstruation. Amenorrhea decreases bone density. Low bone density leads to 
stress fractures and osteoporosis.</p>
<p>It's a cause and effect that every cross-country coach knows well -- &quot;the 
downfall of our sport,&quot; Georgetown University Coach Ron Helmer said -- but even 
experts struggle to address it. Regression, injuries and eating disorders make 
for uncomfortable conversations, and some high school coaches said they hardly 
feel comfortable confronting young runners with such negativity. Other coaches, 
though, said full disclosure works as the best preventative measure.</p>
<p>Almost all cross-country summer camps include seminars on nutrition. Local 
club coach Brian Funk said he asks every girl he coaches about her menstrual 
cycle. Sometimes the conversations feel awkward, Funk said, but they allow him 
to gauge an athlete's sustenance.</p>
<p>&quot;You can't shy away from a tough topic in this sport, because bad things will 
happen,&quot; said Mike Mangan, coach at Lake Braddock Secondary School in Burke. &quot;If 
a girl's body is changing, I'm going to be honest from the start. I'm not going 
to tell them: 'Hey, don't worry about it. You'll be fine in a few weeks.' I'm 
going to be upfront. I'm going to tell them: 'We're in for a long road, but 
we're going to try work through it. You can be a stronger runner and a better 
person on the other side.' &quot;</p>
