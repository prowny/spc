<p>There are some things you never seem to find until you give up looking for 
them: A remote control. An extra set of car keys. An elite tennis career. </p>
<p>England's Tim Henman had spent years desperately, frantically, anxiously 
trying to become this sport's Next Big Thing, yet every time he got close, he 
would trip over his own nerves. It wasn't until he stopped searching so hard 
that his path became clear, and yesterday in the Legg Mason Tennis Classic final 
he took a giant step forward in a 6-3, 6-4 victory over Chilean whirlwind 
Fernando Gonzalez. </p>
<p>&quot;My record in finals has not been particularly good, and part of the problem 
has been that I've wanted it too badly, put a little too much pressure on 
myself, and that did affect my performance,&quot; said Henman, 28, who before 
yesterday hadn't won a title in a year and a half and had never won a title in 
the United States. In the past, those very facts would have twisted his brain 
into a pretzel, but as he clutched his $75,000 winner's check, he seemed more 
than a little loose. </p>
<p>&quot;When I'm playing my best, I'm out there having fun,&quot; he said. &quot;That was my 
strategy coming in here, and I'll be honest -- it's worked much better than I 
thought it would.&quot; </p>
<p>Henman can be forgiven for not discovering this sooner, as he was practically 
swaddled in expectation from birth. His grandfather competed at Wimbledon, as 
did his great grandmother, who in 1901 became the first woman to serve overarm. 
In a country where no native man has won Wimbledon since Fred Perry in 1936, 
that alone would be enough to anoint him a contender, and when Henman showed 
significant promise as a junior, particularly on grass, he became Britain's 
official hope. </p>
<p>For years, the pressure gripped him like a vise, and in one stretch he 
appeared in seven straight tournament finals without winning a single one. The 
Grand Slams were a whole other problem entirely. Henman has never advanced past 
the fourth round of any Slam other than Wimbledon, and while he is a four-time 
semifinalist at the All-England club, he has never made it to the final there.
</p>
<p>When he cracked into the top 10 each of the last three years but never 
finished in the top five, he seemed destined to make a career out of the word 
&quot;almost.&quot; But a shoulder injury that began acting up last summer required 
surgery over the winter, and he continued to experience pain this spring. The 
whole experience forced him to reevaluate both his physical training and his 
mental approach. </p>
<p>&quot;It's never a question with me of just trying harder, that's not going to 
make it better. I'm always out there trying 100 percent,&quot; he said. So instead of 
attempting for 200 percent, he tried just being happy with where he was. </p>
<p>He spent the three weeks after Wimbledon resting, not arriving in Washington 
until the night before the tournament started. And while he hoped to win a 
couple matches, his main focus was to simply work on his game, or as he said the 
other day, &quot;just get to be a better player.&quot; </p>
<p>The effect was that Henman was completely relaxed, even when his matches got 
tight. After coming from behind in his semifinal win over American wunderkind 
Andy Roddick on Saturday, Henman shrugged at the way Roddick had thumped him 6-1 
in the first set, saying, &quot;It's only one set.&quot; </p>
<p>Gonzalez, meantime, only got more wound up the farther he advanced through 
the tournament. Excitable by nature, Gonzalez was practically ready to explode 
on Saturday night after winning an emotional semifinal against top seed and 
boyhood idol Andre Agassi. </p>
<p>By yesterday, he seemed worn. He still attacked the ball with his trademark 
bravado, smacking shots as if points were being awarded for how much they dented 
the court, but instead of watching those shots fall in, he saw the majority of 
them skip out. He fell down 4-0 before getting any rhythm going, and while he 
nearly held Henman off from winning the first set, he promptly allowed Henman to 
break him again at the start of the second. </p>
<p>&quot;I didn't have too many chances, always I was down in the score, and I never 
felt like I could come back,&quot; said Gonzalez, who was also bothered by a sore 
back and several rain delays. &quot;I tried and tried, but it wasn't my day.&quot; </p>
<p>In fact, the only time Gonzalez was able to make a real stand was toward the 
end of the match, when Henman appeared to feel his first wisps of pressure. 
Gonzalez held Henman off for three match points, but when Henman finally batted 
in a forehand swing volley, the title was his. </p>
<p>He immediately took a ball out of his pocket and tried to swat it to the 
crowd. Instead it sailed extremely high, over the upper rows of the stadium and 
into the trees beyond. He laughed. </p>
<p>&quot;This was the most relaxed I've been all week,&quot; he said. &quot;I just felt like 
internally I had a lot of confidence.&quot; </p>
