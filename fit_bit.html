<p>A young athlete's success depends much more on a good attitude than on physical
prowess, concludes a recent survey of youth sport coaches. In a study presented at last
year's annual meeting of the American Psychological Association, Shari Young Kuchenbecker
of Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles reported that &quot;coaches describe young
athletes' positive psychological adjustment--not physical gifts--as the most important
underpinning of athletic success.&quot; </p>

<p>Kuchenbecker surveyed 658 coaches of males and females ages 3 to 22 who participated in
43 sports, including soccer, baseball, basketball, softball, swimming, martial arts and
diving. She asked them to &quot;describe a young athlete who is a real winner&quot; by
picking five attributes from a checklist that included 64 physical and 64 psychological
characteristics. Overwhelmingly, the coaches selected psychological qualities. </p>

<p>The most frequently mentioned attributes were: &quot;loves to play&quot; (43 percent),
&quot;positive attitude&quot; (32.7 percent), &quot;coachable&quot; (29.8 percent),
&quot;self-motivated&quot; (27.4 percent) and &quot;team player&quot; (25.7 percent). The
other qualities rounding out the top 10 were &quot;strives to improve&quot; (21.1
percent), &quot;dedicated&quot; (20.8 percent), &quot;gives best effort always&quot; (18.5
percent), &quot;good sportsmanship&quot; (16.3 percent) and &quot;encourages/praises
others&quot; (14.6 percent). </p>

<p>Surprisingly, physical skills rated low. The first physical characteristic
mentioned--&quot;natural physical athlete&quot;--came in 19th on the list of top qualities
and was selected by just 10.9 percent of coaches. &quot;Physically pushes self&quot; was
20th on the list, cited by 9.7 percent of coaches; &quot;good eye-hand coordination&quot;
was 21st, mentioned by 8.8 percent; and &quot;physically gifted&quot; was 24th, mentioned
by 5.8 percent. </p>

<p>The coaches placed the strongest emphasis on psychological aspects when describing
&quot;a real winner.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Coaches also cited two top damaging forces to developing young
athletes--criticism and pressure,&quot; said Kuchenbecker, who noted that male and female
coaches had similar responses. Parents who want their children to succeed in sports--and
in life--should encourage and support these positive psychological attributes, says
Kuchenbecker. Instead of asking a child, &quot;Did you win?&quot; she recommends asking a
young athlete, &quot;How did you play?&quot; This question isn't about the
outcome--winning or losing--which may be beyond a youngster's control, she says. It's
about the much more important, and controllable, aspect of the game--a youngster's
thoughts and feelings about his or her sport experience. </p>

<p>&quot;A parent's role is to listen and support the positive,&quot; says Kuchenbecker,
who elaborates on different scenarios, from the disaster to the triumph, in her book
&quot;Raising Winners: A Parent's Guide to Helping Players Succeed On and Off the
Field,&quot; to be published in the spring by Times Random House. &quot;Your role as a
parent is critically important, yet ideally, you're invisible. Many parents think the best
way to get their children ahead is to talk to the coach, but that's not the place you need
to be. Your work is with your child, to be there when they need support.&quot; </p>

<p>Many of sport's most important lessons occur off the field, notes Kuchenbecker, who has
three children--two in college and one in high school--who all played sports. &quot;Kids
need to learn that sometimes you play, and sometimes you don't play,&quot; she says.
&quot;Riding the bench, yet still having a good attitude, is an important life
skill.&quot; </p>

<p>Often a parent's biggest contribution, she says, &quot;is listening. You can serve as a
balance that helps the child sort things out. . . . The important thing is that you're
there for your child.&quot; </p>
