<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the 
Mental Game?&nbsp; Sports Psychology?&nbsp; The Zone?&nbsp; Mental Toughness?&nbsp; You’ve heard the 
terms but may not know what they really mean.&nbsp; You may even agree that the 
concept is important enough to learn, but don’t know exactly how to do that.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many 
researchers, coaches, and athletes have talked about the mental game in sports.&nbsp; 
Timothy Gallwey was one of the first to write about “The Inner Game of Tennis” 
in 1974.&nbsp; In the introduction to that book he says <i>“the inner game is the 
game that takes place in the mind of the player, and it is played against such 
obstacles as lapses in concentration, nervousness, self-doubt and 
self-condemnation.&nbsp; In short, it is played to overcome all habits of mind which 
inhibit excellence in performance.”</i> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The late 
Charles M. Schulz, creator of “Peanuts” cartoons, was also a wise sports 
psychologist.&nbsp; In one cartoon strip, Snoopy is watching Woodstock attempt to fly 
from the roof of his doghouse: <i>“Now when you take off, do you push with your 
feet?&nbsp; Or do you flap your wings first?&nbsp; Do you sort of lean into it, or do 
you…”</i> KLUNK! Woodstock has fallen to the ground.&nbsp; Snoopy says: <i>“If you 
think about it, you can’t do it.”</i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mental game 
involves <u>all</u> the thoughts and feelings going on inside your head - - 
before, during, and after a competition - - whether you are consciously aware of 
them or not.&nbsp; Any negative attitudes - - about yourself, opponent, teammate, the 
weather - - diminish your ability to play your best.&nbsp; Athletes do not perform 
well when involved in self-judgment, self-criticism, or analytical (“What 
happened there?” “Why?”) thoughts.&nbsp; You perform best when you are playing 
automatically and instinctively.&nbsp; Athletes who have experienced “playing in the 
zone” often use these descriptions: <i>“mindless…effortless…time stood 
still…intensely focused and relaxed at the same time.”</i>&nbsp; While these phrases 
may sound mystical or mysterious, there are specific skills which anyone can 
learn and practice in order to achieve such a positive mental state and optimal 
athletic performance.&nbsp; To play your best, you must develop and maintain these 
mental traits: concentration, self-confidence, and a love of the challenge.&nbsp; <i>
You focus on playing your personal best, rather than on the outcome of winning.</i> 
&nbsp;Just as you feel awkward when trying a new stroke or grip, mental skills 
require time and practice before they feel natural.&nbsp; When you have prepared 
sufficiently, you can trust your body to do what it knows how to do - - without 
your having to tell it what to do during competition.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">
The ability to control your thoughts and feelings under the pressure of 
competition, combined with good coaching, consistent physical training, and 
dedicated drilling, will lead to great sports performance.&nbsp; When the mental and 
physical games are in balance, athletes play their best.</span></p>
