Brendan Hansen</span></a><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif"> 
was swimming in his second Olympics — and had no idea why.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">&nbsp;“I’m 
looking at the other end of the pool in the final of the 100 breaststroke and 
going, ‘Am I really <i>still</i> doing this?’ ” Hansen said. “Am I really still 
swimming? Still? At 27?”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">The 
athletes who gather this week in Omaha for the U.S. Olympic swimming trials may 
talk about training methods and tapers, nutrition and nerves. But in their most 
honest moments, they talk, too, about the forces that ate at Hansen for so long. 
At some point long ago, each of these women and men jumped into a pool for the 
first time as girls and boys to have fun, kids splashing about. And at some 
point, after having devoted so much of their lives to swimming, many of them 
want nothing more to do with it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">Take 
Hansen, in 2008, after Beijing.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">“I wanted 
to get as far away from the pool as possible,” he said. “I felt like I had been 
cheated. I felt like I worked really hard and never saw the benefits of it.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">Hansen 
turns 31 this summer, and in pools from Omaha to London, where the Olympics 
begin next month, there will be tears of joy and heartbreak. Yet the tidy 
interpretations of those emotions — of overwhelming satisfaction from a victory, 
crippling devastation from a defeat — don’t begin to explain the complicated 
relationships many athletes have with their sports. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">Swimmers 
are only a subset, Hansen maybe this year’s best example. They have given so 
much, with no guarantees as to what they’ll get back. They endure early-morning 
workouts, miss weddings and birthday parties, delay marriages and parenthood, 
hit the pause button on the rest of their lives for years — and for what?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">After the 
2008 Olympics, Hansen walked out. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">“Those 
things add up after a while, and you’re like, ‘Dude, life is passing me by while 
I’m staring at a black line on the bottom of the pool,’ ” Hansen said. “That 
just didn’t feel right anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">Yet here 
he is, trying to make his third Olympic team, the sport of swimming front and 
center in his life again. Yes, he took two years completely off. Yes, he became 
a triathlete. Yes, he worked for a start-up company, a regular job. And yes, he 
got married. But the pull of the pool, for someone who had known nothing else 
for two decades, somehow sucked him in again.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">
“Whatever’s going on in my life, I feel like if I swim,” Hansen said, “I can 
kind of center myself and be at my best.” </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">Centering 
himself means something different from what it once did, because Hansen's 
career, to this point, is defined by a lack of return on his investments. He set 
world records in the 100- and 200-meter breaststrokes at the 2004 Olympic 
trials. Given that precedent, his performance at the Athens Games — silver in 
the 100, bronze in the 200, with slower times in each event, and a gold in the 
medley relay — was viewed in some corners as a failure. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">There was 
even an infuriating wrinkle: Most members of the American team believed Hansen’s 
chief rival, Japan’s Kosuke Kitajima, used an illegal kick to beat him in the 
100.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">Either 
way, that failure — or that <i>perception</i> of failure — fueled Hansen into 
2008. “I felt like I got robbed in 2004,” he said, “so I need to come back and 
make this huge appearance.” </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">It didn’t 
work. In the 200 breaststroke at trials, Hansen swam slowly. He was overtaken in 
the final 25 meters. He didn’t make the team in his best event. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">“I’m not 
sure I still know what happened in that event,” said Eddie Reese, Hansen’s coach 
at the University of Texas, his coach in 2004 and ’08, his coach now. “Once the 
gun goes off, a lot of things go through their minds.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">But what 
about <i>before</i> the gun goes off? Not just seconds prior, but days and weeks 
and months? This is a topic of discussion for swimmers in those weary moments 
before the sun rises, or on the weekends given up to their sport, traveling the 
world but seeing little more than hotel rooms and competition venues. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">Then, the 
big-picture questions — the ones that can leave one of the best swimmers in the 
world standing on a starting block wondering why he’s still there — creep in.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">“He got so 
caught up in all of it,” said Hansen’s wife, Martha, “he forgot why he swam in 
the first place.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in"><b>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">‘Why do 
you play sports?’</span></b><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">This 
experience is not unique to Hansen. Aaron Peirsol, perhaps the best backstroker 
in history, trained with Hansen at Texas. For years, including twice at the 
Olympics, Peirsol led off the best U.S. medley relay team, touched the wall, and 
Hansen dove in for the second leg. Twice they won gold together. They know all 
too well the why-do-we-do-this discussions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">“Where, 
along the way, did you lose the reason you wanted to do your sport to begin 
with?” Peirsol said. “We talk about it all the time. When you’re a kid, why do 
you play sports? So you can fall down and get back up. Get tough, get dirty, and 
play, and you enjoy the process of learning and not being judged and standing 
back up and doing it again. Then there’s junior Olympics, or school, or Olympic 
medals that become the goals, and they can detract from the whole reason you 
began to do it to begin with. 
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">
“Everyone’s told that hard work pays off. Not really. If you really like it, 
you’ll work hard. But if you don’t like it, and you’re being told to work hard, 
you’re not going to like it. You’re going to resent it.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">This, from 
a swimmer who won five gold medals and two silvers in his three Olympics, who 
still owns the world records in the 100- and 200-meter backstrokes, who is 
younger than Hansen — and who retired even though he could have been a factor in 
London.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">“I stopped 
because I stopped, man,” Peirsol said. “I’m done.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">Unlike 
Hansen, Peirsol continued to swim after the 2008 Games. He had a spectacular 
2009 season, and seemed headed toward a fourth Olympics. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">But at the 
2010 U.S. Nationals in Irvine, Calif., he finished second in the 100 backstroke 
to an upstart, David Plummer. Reese, who also coached Peirsol at Texas and 
through his pro career, asked him afterward: “What did you feel before that 
race?”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">“I was 
emotionally flat,” Peirsol told Reese. “I’ve never felt that way before a race 
before.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">His 
relationship with swimming had changed. The following February, despite the fact 
that he had earned the right to swim that summer in the world championships in 
Shanghai, he left. Unlike Hansen, he filed retirement papers. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">&nbsp;“I 
thought I was grown up,” said Peirsol, who turns 29 next month. “I got away from 
swimming, and I realized I had some growing up to do.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">But even 
when it’s pulled off at the right time, a departure can leave a void. Peirsol 
will be back at the Olympics this summer, sitting in the stands. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">“It’ll be 
emotional for me,” he said, “just because it meant so much to me.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in"><b>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">‘Is this a 
stupid idea?’</span></b><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">Late in 
2010, just as he passed two years without swimming, Hansen started thinking 
about what he had left behind, about what was left undone. Even with his two 
gold medals from the medley relays in ’04 and ’08, the Olympics had been wholly 
unsatisfying. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">Martha, a 
former Texas swimmer whom Hansen had dated since college and who he married in 
May 2010, asked him, simply: “Are you going to regret this when you’re 40 years 
old?”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">“Yeah, 
probably,” Hansen replied.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">“Well, I 
don’t want to live with that guy,” Martha said, according to Brendan. “So get 
your ass in the water.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">Thus, on 
Jan. 7, 2011 — a date clearly stamped in his mind — Hansen scheduled a lunch 
with Reese. His first question: “Is this a stupid idea?” Reese looked at his 
student, fitter than he had ever been, refreshed in a way he had never been.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">“It was an 
easy, ‘Yes,’ to let him do it,” Reese said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">They made 
a deal that Hansen would quietly begin training with the Texas team, and the two 
would have another conversation in a month. That second discussion was not 
necessary. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">Hansen 
swam fast when he got in the pool. He has gotten faster still. And he has done 
so, those around him said, on his own terms. The questions he posed in his own 
mind, on that starting block in Beijing, are gone. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">“He’s back 
because he wants to be back,” Peirsol said. “He came back with the idea that, if 
it works, it works. The irony is that he’ll probably end up doing better with 
that idea than, ‘I sure as hell better win.’ ”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">He will be 
in the pool Monday in Omaha, in the same arena which brought him so much misery 
four years ago, for the 100 breaststroke. He believes it will feel like a 
different place because his attitude is so different.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">“I almost 
feel like he’s younger now than he was in 2008,” Martha Hansen said. “He has a 
more juvenile spirit now, a healthier outlook.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">What that 
will yield, he does not know. He hasn’t matched the 2012 times put up by Eric 
Shanteau, who owns the American records in both breaststroke events, marks 
Hansen once held. He believes that does not matter. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">“I’m 
really going to kind of stop and enjoy the roses and really enjoy the experience 
and whatever the outcome is, because I honestly believe that this is all just a 
dream for me,” Hansen said. “And I’m just going to enjoy the journey, and 
whatever the outcome is, I’ll deal with that at the end. 
I’ll just be glad I gave it a try. Just giving it a try: It is a child’s thought,
a kid’s motivation. And it is a most novel approach at swimming’s highest level.
