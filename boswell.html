<p>A moment in golf arrives that every player understands. Some great goal is
finally within reach. No, not just within reach. More, much more, than that. The
job is all but done. Nothing but a total collapse, an ignominious choke, a
complete public disgracing of yourself can prevent you from achieving your
dream.</p>
<p>Then the nightmare begins, as it began for Frank Lickliter yesterday on the
last three holes of the Kemper Open.</p>
<p>For the first time all week, he made the horrid mistake of asking his caddie,
&quot;How are we doing?&quot;</p>
<p>For five days, through rain delays, canceled rounds, postponed play and
tornado warnings, he'd ignored every leader board. So now, with just three holes
left to complete his first Tour win, he decides to ask for up-to-the-moment
info.</p>
<p>&quot;We're three up, mate,&quot; came the answer from his caddie.</p>
<p>What happened next is the oldest, most bitter story in golf. A fine fellow,
with his life's ambition in his grasp, unravels -- shot after blundering shot --
for all his friends, peers and fans to see. One poor shot begets another, which
leads to foggy thinking that produces more embarrassment.</p>
<p>Oh, Lickliter endured the whole golf torture treatment on those final three
holes yesterday. The 16th hole produced a hooked drive, a pushed iron from the
rough, a weak pitch and a missed putt. Bogey. Lead down to two. At the 17th, he
cautiously pulled an iron 50 feet left of the hole to avoid water, then misread
the speed of a lag putt and missed a five-foot comebacker. His caddie misread
that putt. Lickliter believed him against his own judgment. Just one more twist
of the knife. Bogey. Lead down to one.</p>
<p>Yes, this was the same fellow who, at the Buick Invitational in February,
with a chance for that first win, made a classic strategy blunder in a playoff.
Phil Mickelson hit his drive far into a canyon on a par 4 and ended up making a
double bogey. Lickliter should have played safe. Instead, he hit driver, too,
blasted it into the same canyon and made an egregious double bogey of his own.
After that, of course, the gods made sure Mickelson won.</p>
<p>On the Kemper's 18th tee, not one shirt in the gallery on a cool day --
neither fan nor player -- showed a single drop of sweat. Lickliter's shirt was
soaked down the back and armpits. Sweating bullets isn't just an expression.
After hitting a good drive, Lickliter found a spot where cameras wouldn't catch
him taking a drink of water and sneaking a cigarette. The only thing missing
from the scene was a blindfold.</p>
<p>His 7-iron shot into the 18th, needing a par to win, was pulled into the
rough beside the green. Next, he fluffed his 20-foot pitch, leaving it a gapping
eight feet from the hole. Horrid stuff.</p>
<p>Furious, Lickliter fired his ball at his caddie from short range. &quot;That
was soft compared to some I've [thrown] at him,&quot; Lickliter said.</p>
<p>Over the last 25 years, we've watched this same painful disaster many times
at tournaments great and small. Every single time -- or so it seems -- a
juncture is reached when we know that our victim is caught in golf's cross
hairs. He's a goner. Maybe it's Mark Weibe blowing a two-shot lead with three to
play in the Kemper. Or Curtis Strange throwing away a match against Nick Faldo
to lose the Ryder Cup in 1995. Or Ed Snead bogeying the last three holes to
squander the Masters.</p>
<p>Each time, there is one final putt on the 18th green that can undo the
humiliation, save the match, salvage the tournament. Just make this one
tormenting putt to save yourself. It's always long enough to miss, but short
enough to make if you strike it perfectly.</p>
<p>Name one player who -- after falling apart so badly along that last mile --
had the inner resources to make that final putt to redeem himself. Several
veteran golf writers quizzed each other trying to name a single survivor,
balanced against a long list of those who'd failed. Nobody could remember one
counter example.</p>
<p>Now we have one. Frank Lickliter made the putt.</p>
<p>Perhaps only 2,500 people were around the final green to see that par putt
drop squarely in the hole -- a stroke as perfect as the dozen before it had been
flawed. How many realized what they'd seen? Everybody has his own standards. For
me, Lickliter's putt might have been the most remarkable shot I've seen in 21
Kempers.</p>
<p>&quot;It wasn't pretty . . . didn't feel pretty,&quot; Lickliter said after
his victory. &quot;It looks like I'll be playing here for the next 20
years.&quot;</p>
<p>And, hopefully, he'll be asked about that final putt a thousand times.
Because it's worth retelling.</p>
<p>&quot;I just trusted myself . . . I knew how it was going to break because I
actually had that [same] putt two years ago. And I missed it [to the]
right,&quot; Lickliter said. &quot;It's amazing what you remember from years
past. Eventually, it gets into my head, through my thick skull.&quot;</p>
<p>How could he compose himself, re-collect himself, when so many others in his
sport have rushed or hesitated or yipped in identical moments. &quot;I told
myself, 'Just get back totally into the moment.' And for some reason I did it
extremely well. Even after everything that had happened the last half hour. I
had no thoughts except reading the putt and making it.&quot;</p>
<p>Later, Lickliter added, wolfishly, &quot;Maybe it helps that I'm just a
little mean.&quot;</p>
<p>Some might tell you that the Kemper now has another no-name first-time
winner. That's not right. If you want some easy money, just say, &quot;I bet
Lickliter is one of the 100 top money winners in the history of the PGA Tour. In
fact, I bet he's won more money than Arnold Palmer and Gary Player
combined.&quot; And you'd be right.</p>
<p>Lickliter has been one of the Tour's accomplished, but unrecognized players
in recent years. Lack of a win has been the reason. Now, he won't be Lackliter
any more.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been a long time coming. And it's finally here,&quot; he said.
&quot;It's sweet.&quot;</p>
<p>Perhaps it was appropriate that Lickliter's final stroke was played before
the smallest gallery, by far, ever to see a Kemper Open won. Yesterday was a day
for the hardest of hard-core golf lovers, those who play or understand the
nuances of their game.</p>
<p>They were the right group to appreciate a truly remarkable moment. A man on
the verge of the worst choke of his career suddenly summoned himself for the
best clutch shot of his life.</p>
