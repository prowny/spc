<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">If 
you watched the Boys 16 &amp; 18 Super National Clay Court Championships recently 
played at our local clubs, you probably saw some great tennis.&nbsp; You may also 
have witnessed some boys throwing rackets and bags, or swearing loudly.&nbsp; At 
another tennis match some years ago, one parent violently assaulted another 
parent while watching their sons play.&nbsp; On the sidelines of any soccer or Little 
League game we all observe a range of player and parent attitudes.&nbsp; No one likes 
to lose, and most people don’t like to lose their temper.&nbsp; Yet both things 
happen.&nbsp; While we can’t control the outcome of a sports event, we can control 
our own behavior.&nbsp; Truly successful competitive athletes must learn good 
sportsmanship, and their parents need to set an example of behavior which is 
polite, respectful, and honorable.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">
How do we instill the best attitudes in our young athletes?&nbsp; Here are some 
guidelines:</span></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" type="disc">
  <li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Understand that sports 
  is just a game.&nbsp; It’s not a job or a business.&nbsp; Kids play sports primarily to 
  have fun, to enjoy the challenge, and for social camaraderie.&nbsp; Focus on your 
  child’s enjoyment, not your own reasons for your child to play sports.&nbsp; If you 
  are more invested in your child’s participation than he or she is, there will 
  be problems.</span></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Before lessons, 
  practice, or competitions:&nbsp; Ask your child whether he or she prefers you to 
  watch, or to keep your distance.&nbsp; If you are allowed on the sidelines, be 
  unobtrusive, refrain from coaching, and stay calm and neutral.&nbsp; Parents who 
  hover, instruct, cheer or jeer put extra pressure on a young athlete.&nbsp; This 
  can lead to tension and mistakes, or even cheating.</span></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Children need to know 
  you still love them even when they play badly or lose a competition.&nbsp; If you 
  avoid emphasizing results, kids will get that you care for them more than 
  their trophies.&nbsp; Ask questions like “Did you have fun?&nbsp; Did you try your 
  hardest?” instead of “Did you win?”</span></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Comfort your child after 
  a loss but remember that losing is part of a necessary learning process.&nbsp; Most 
  athletes, however talented, will eventually be beaten by someone better.&nbsp; Kids 
  need time to be upset, then get over it.&nbsp; Parents can help by remaining calm 
  and supportive, no matter the outcome.&nbsp; After a useful cooling off period, 
  encourage your child to think about what went on during the match.&nbsp; By talking 
  about <b><i>what went right and wrong</i></b>, players appreciate their 
  strengths and weaknesses, and parents also learn what their child is 
  thinking.&nbsp; Maybe this will be different than you expect, and different from 
  your own reactions.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What if you’ve 
sacrificed so much time and money on your child’s sport and he or she wants to 
quit?&nbsp; Your child may be tired, injured, frustrated or bored.&nbsp; He or she may 
need to take a break from competing; try some different sports; develop other 
social activities that are stress-free.&nbsp; &nbsp;If your child ultimately decides to 
abandon the sport, consider that you still have made a substantial investment in 
his or her development as a person.</span></p>
