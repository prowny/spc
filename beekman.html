<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">For more 
than a decade, former Walter Johnson High School standout swimmer Eric Friedland 
has dedicated nearly 20 hours per week to elite-level training.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">He’s 
sometimes out of bed before the sun rises for morning workouts, and he deals 
with fatigue and muscle soreness on a daily basis.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">And it’s 
all for two minutes of swimming — Friedland’s team-best time in the 200-yard 
breaststroke during his senior season at the University of Texas in 2011-12 was 
1 minute, 59.96 seconds.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">“When you 
put it that way, it’s hard to give up every day [to train]. But after you 
accomplish your goals, when you have a good swim, when you do well at a 
competition, it’s worth all the time and effort,” said Friedland, who competed 
in the U.S. Olympic Swim Trials this year for the second time. “Every day you 
have to keep thinking that.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0in">
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">Friedland 
has “it.”</span></p>
<p>The 2011 NCAA 200 breaststroke champion has the intangibles, that enviable 
mental strength that enables him to remain focused and dedicated to achieving 
the goals he sets, the capacity to put his best foot, or in his case, arm, 
forward when it most matters. And he has that unwavering self-confidence in 
himself that helps him bounce back from those few instances where he doesn’t 
perform his best.</p>
<p>But there are plenty naturally gifted athletes who cannot see past the 
arduous training it takes to reach the pinnacle of a sport and who buckle under 
the pressure of an important game or race.</p>
<p>Despite all the potential benefits that athletics can provide, 75 percent of 
all sport participants will drop out of sport by the time they are 13, said Dr. 
Caroline Silby, who holds a doctorate and master’s degree in sports psychology 
from the University of Virginia and is a faculty member at American University.</p>
<p>“Youth sport participants cite too much pressure and lack of enjoyment as 
reasons for their early exit,” added Silby, who has worked individually with 10 
Olympians, two of them gold medalists.</p>
<p>Genetics play a major role in athletic achievement. But perhaps the biggest 
differentiating factor in determining which athletes are cut out for top NCAA 
Division I athletic programs and professional sports is what goes on between the 
ears.</p>
<p>“When you have two equally talented athletes, people need to have a certain 
amount of innate ability, but two people of equal ability, the one who has the 
better mental attitude is the one who is going to be the superior athlete,” said 
Sheila Rowny of Sports Psychotherapy in Bethesda.</p>
<p>As sports continue to evolve at a rapid rate thanks to constant technological 
advances and sports medicine studies, more and more athletes are becoming aware 
of the importance of the mental game.</p>
<p>In the past decade, Rowny said it’s been more publicly accepted for coaches 
and athletes to seek help.</p>
<p>According to Sports Psychology Today, virtually every college, national, 
professional and Olympic team has a psychologist on staff, and it is estimated 
that more than 300 professional golfers work individually with sports 
psychologists.</p>
<p>“[Mental strength] is so important [in sports],” Friedland said. “I haven’t 
personally seen anyone for help but a bunch of my friends have and say it’s 
totally worth it.”</p>
<p>Achieving mental strength, Silby said, is a life-long process.</p>
<p>Pressure cookerMental strength can be measured by a variety of factors.</p>
<p>An athlete’s ability to perform under pressure, to brush aside mistakes and 
setbacks, seems to the be the focal point for the general public.</p>
<p>“Michael Jordan was described as ‘Knowing how to win,’” Silby said.</p>
<p>Ninety percent of Silby’s clients, she said, are looking for ways to 
consistently perform their best when it counts the most.</p>
<p>Pre-competition nerves, Silby said, actually can be channeled into positive 
performances if handled correctly.</p>
<p>“Mental skills such as mindfulness training, self-talk, visualization, mental 
game plans, focus points, mental pacing and pre-competition routines have helped 
athletes to accept the nervousness and respond to cues that facilitate 
high-level performance,” she added.</p>
<p>Certain practices, like breathing techniques and pre-competition routines or 
rituals can help keep an athlete’s nerves in check.</p>
<p>“Before each pitch I take a deep breath in my windup, it helps me kind of 
relax and get my mind set for the next pitch,” said Germantown resident Tori 
Finucane, one of the nation’s best 18-and-under softball pitchers who has 
verbally committed to play on scholarship at the University of Missouri in 
2013-14.</p>
<p>Practice makes perfect</p>
<p>Silby said athletes tend to fall into two categories.</p>
<p>One group of athletes thrives under pressure — the proverbial “clutch” 
players.</p>
<p>The other group are the perfectionists — the athletes who can outwork anyone 
and typically “win” every practice session, but they tend to falter when 
everything is on the line.</p>
<p>An athlete who can combine the two could be virtually unstoppable.</p>
<p>Longtime Winston Churchill High School girls soccer coach Haroot Hakopian 
said working on mental strength has been a part of his team’s daily routine for 
the past three years.</p>
<p>In that time the Bulldogs have reached three consecutive Class 4A West Region 
finals, losing two one-goal decisions and one in penalty kicks to four-time 
defending state champion Bethesda-Chevy Chase.</p>
<p>Goal-setting, Hakopian said, helps the Bulldogs remain focused.</p>
<p>Ride the roller coaster</p>
<p>Even the best athletes inevitably have their ups and downs. Finding mental 
stability during those times is imperative.</p>
<p>Sometimes surviving hardships can make someone that much more unflappable.</p>
<p>“It starts with yourself and your mindset, having confidence that you can do 
it and wanting to push yourself,” Finucane said. “Last year I could not throw a 
strike to save my life. I was very frustrated with myself. But I worked that 
much harder than I ever had. This year I’ve come back better, physically, but 
also mentally. If I walk a batter, it’s no big deal. There’s another batter 
coming up now.”</p>
<p>Rowny said athletes in a similar situation will have learned a whole new set 
of mental skills, making them that much more prepared moving forward.</p>
<p>As children are encouraged to specialize in their sports at younger ages 
these days, mental training, Silby and Rowny agreed, becomes even more 
important.</p>
<p>It’s something that can be facilitated by coaches and parents.</p>
<p>Hakopian said he finds the high school age to be the perfect time to start a 
mental training regimen.</p>
<p>“You can take an average player who can make herself into a good player by 
being mentally tough. I’ve coached hundreds of those,” Hakopian said. “Then you 
can get the naturally gifted ones and try to click in with the mental training. 
Once in 10 years that type of athlete comes along where they’re driven, they’re 
focused, they know where they want to be and they’re going to get there no 
matter what.”</p>
